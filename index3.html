  <h1>Types of Programming Languages</h1>
  <h2>High level programming languages</h2>
  <p style="font-size:17px">high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low level programming languages. it may use natural language elements or it sometimes be easier than the natural language.he process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower level language.</p>

  <h3>Advantage of High level programming languages:</h3>
  <ol type="1">
   <li>The programs written in high level Programming language and it's independent that mean it could be run on another system.</li>
   <li>Easy to understand becase it have a keywords, function and class that looks loke English words that makes it understandable.</li>
   <li>Easy to code,read and editing.also we can edit programs which is written by other Programmers easly.</li>
   <li>High level progra languages are slower than Low level programming languages but it's still popular to developer</li>
