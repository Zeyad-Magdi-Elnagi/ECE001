  <h1>Types of Programming Languages</h1>
  <h2>Low level programming languages</h2>
  <p style="font-size:17px">low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions.</p>

    <dt><b>Machine code:</b></dt>
    <dd>Machine code is the only language a computer can process directly without a previous transformation. Currently, programmers almost never write programs directly in machine code, because it requires attention to numerous details that a high-level language handles automatically. Furthermore, it requires memorizing or looking up numerical codes for every instruction, and is extremely difficult to modify.<b>For Example:</b></dd>

    <dt><b>Assembly Language:</b></dt>
    <dd>Second generation languages provide one abstraction level on top of the machine code. In the early days of coding on computers like the TX-0 and PDP-1 the first thing MIT hackers did was write assemblers.Assembly language has little semantics or formal specification and being only a mapping of human readable symbols and including symbolic addresses to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants, strings and so on.one machine instruction is represented as one line of assembly code. Assemblers produce object files that can link with other object files or be loaded on their own.<b>For Example</b></dd>
